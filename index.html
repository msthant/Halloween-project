    <p class="All_about_Halloween">Ancient Celts who lived in Northern Europe were the first people to celebrated Halloween. They believed that on October 31, the spirits of the dead roam or the ghosts came to our earth and would harm to us by many different ways. That’s why, people would leave food and drinks on their door steps for the ghosts and sprits. During Samhain, Celts dressed up in scary costumes and make noise in the streets to keep these sprits away.</p>
