<!--    Trick_or_Treat-->
    <p class="Trick_or_Treat">It is believed that the trick-or-treating connected to the old tradition of Souling. Children and sometimes poor adults go house to house to beg for food such as soul cakes or money, in exchange for songs and prayers for homeownerâ€™s dead family members. This was called Souling. But in Scotland and Ireland it was called guising. </p>
